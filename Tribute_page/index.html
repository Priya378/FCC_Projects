                <li><strong>1904: </strong>Graduates from Town Higher School. Joins Government Arts College Kumbakonam, on scholarship. Gets preoccupied with mathematics that his scholarship is revoked</li>

                <p>“It was his insight into algebraical formulae, transformations of infinite series, and so forth that was most amazing. On this side most certainly I have never met his equal, and I can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi.”</p><cite>--Mathematician G.H. Hardy</cite>
